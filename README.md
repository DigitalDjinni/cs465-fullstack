Architecture

This project’s architecture was built using the MEAN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. For the frontend, I used the Angular framework to create a dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA), as Angular allowed for a more interactive and seamless user experience compared to static pages. For simpler tasks such as rendering static HTML or handling forms, Express HTML and JavaScript were very effective, especially in areas where dynamic interaction was unnecessary. When comparing the three, Angular was definitely more advanced when it came to providing interactivity and responsiveness, while Express HTML and JavaScript excelled in their simplicity for straightforward tasks.

When it came to the backend, I used Express to handle the backend logic and routing, as it seamlessly integrated with Node.js to manage API endpoints. For data storage, I used a NoSQL database, MongoDB, due to its ability to handle unstructured data, as well as its ability for future scaling.

Functionality

When it came to the app’s functionality, it relied heavily on smooth communication between the frontend and backend, which was made possible through using JSON. When it comes to how JSON is different from JavaScript, JSON is a lightweight data format that was designed specifically for data exchange, while JavaScript is a programming language. JSON in this application acted as the bridge between the frontend and backend, enabling consistent and efficient data transfer through API endpoints.

During development, I focused on refactoring to improve functionality and efficiency. For example, I focused on making the code clean and refactored elements into reuseable components. These changes not only made the code more maintainable but also allowed for faster updates.

Testing

For this application testing was vital to ensure the app’s reliability and security. For testing I used Postman and tested all the API endpoints to verify that methods such as GET and POST worked correctly. Since the app included authentication for secure admin access, I did additional testing including inputting invalid logins and expired tokens, to confirm error handling was properly implemented.

Reflection

Working on this MEAN stack project has been a huge step forward for me in terms of technical and professional growth, especially when it comes to my field of Computer Science. Through this project I’ve gained hands-on experience with integrating frontend and backend technologies, securing applications, and optimizing overall performance. I have also developed skills, such as using frameworks, refactoring code, and creating reusable components, which will be important in future projects. This project has both made me more confident in my abilities as well as feeling prepared for tackling real-world challenges in full stack development.
